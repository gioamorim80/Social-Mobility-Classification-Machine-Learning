# Social-Mobility-Classification-Machine-Learning
Flatiron Data Science Bootcamp Module 5 Final Project

The goal of this project is to select a problem and solve it/answer it through a supervised machine learning classification project.

For this project I chose to work with a social justice topic. I'm using geographical based (census tracts) data to classify outcomes in terms of upward social mobility.

The data was made available by Opportunity Insights, a group of researchers and policy analysts based at Harvard University.

On this notebook we clean the data, do some feature engineering and then use Pipelines to find the best type of supervised model to work with. We then again use a Pipeline together with a Grid-search Cross-Validation to fine tune the hyperparameters of our model in order to improve it. Finally we access the scorings and results of our model while testing it on unseen data.
